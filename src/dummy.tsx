    title: "GENDER SPACE AND THE MISINTERPRETATION OF CHRISTIAN DOCTRINES IN WOMEN ABUSE: SOCIAL WORK INTERVENTION WITH WOMEN IN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP",
    abstract:
      "This paper x-rayed the spate of violence against women by using Mrs. Osinachi who died due to injuries she suffered from domestic assaults as a case study. It espoused the counsels and teaching of the Christian doctrines and how these are employed to manipulate women to accept and continue to endure the harsh and intimidating relationships with their spouses. The paper also established that the custodians of the Christian doctrines who are mainly men amplify the verses of the Bible that focus primarily on women to be submissive while they are silent about the areas that command men not to abuse their wives. Content analysis was use to analyzed secondary data which were comprehensively reviewed and important themes isolated and analyzed based on the goals of the study. The paper recommends that social worker should begin to offer direct services to women in churches and market places through workshop, seminar, symposium and person to person approach in order to liberate them (women) from any manipulation facilitated by religious counsels and teachings.",
