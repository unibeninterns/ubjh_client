    title: "GENDER SPACE AND THE MISINTERPRETATION OF CHRISTIAN DOCTRINES IN WOMEN ABUSE: SOCIAL WORK INTERVENTION WITH WOMEN IN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP",
    abstract:
      "This paper x-rayed the spate of violence against women by using Mrs. Osinachi who died due to injuries she suffered from domestic assaults as a case study. It espoused the counsels and teaching of the Christian doctrines and how these are employed to manipulate women to accept and continue to endure the harsh and intimidating relationships with their spouses. The paper also established that the custodians of the Christian doctrines who are mainly men amplify the verses of the Bible that focus primarily on women to be submissive while they are silent about the areas that command men not to abuse their wives. Content analysis was use to analyzed secondary data which were comprehensively reviewed and important themes isolated and analyzed based on the goals of the study. The paper recommends that social worker should begin to offer direct services to women in churches and market places through workshop, seminar, symposium and person to person approach in order to liberate them (women) from any manipulation facilitated by religious counsels and teachings.",

    abstract:
      "This study examined the extent of utilization of e-learning technologies in business education programme in tertiary institutions in Nigeria. Four research questions guided the study. The study adopted a descriptive survey research design. The population of the study comprised five hundred and twenty-one (521) Business Education 100level, 200leveel and 400level students in the University of Benin (UNIBEN) and Benson Idahosa University (BIU), out of which 100 students were used as sample, using the disproportionate stratified random sampling technique. A structured questionnaire containing twenty-two items was the instrument used in obtaining responses from respondents. The reliability of the instrument was using Cronbach Alpha reliability computation which yielded a co-efficient index of 0.93. Data collected were analyzed using Mean and Standard Deviation for the research questions. The findings of the study revealed that e-learning technologies were not adequately utilized in business education programme in tertiary institutions in Nigeria. Based on the findings it was recommended that: the relevant authorities should create an avenue for uninterrupted power supply, this is necessary because e-learning technologies cannot be utilized effectively without power supply. Also, in-service training programmes such as on the job training and retraining programmes, seminars, workshop on the utilization of e-learning technologies should be mounted on a regular basis for serving business educators and students in tertiary institutions.",

    title: "AN EPISTEMOLOGICAL EVALUATION OF THE METAPHYSICAL PHENOMENA OF LIFE AFTER DEATH AND NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCES",
    abstract:
      "This study examines the metaphysical periscope of the phenomena of life after death and near death experiences with the lenses of epistemology and logic. Although most cultures and religions accept the belief in life after death unassailably, the questions concerning its actuality, its nature, and near death experiences have been under keen debates by some thinkers in the disciplines of Philosophy, Religion and Psychology. This study analyses these metaphysical phenomena critically and exposes in details some religious, cultural and psychological claims made about them. It examines the epistemological and logical status of these knowledge claims. The study argues that although some claims made about afterlife and near death experiences seem rational and convincing; any claim to knowledge of absolute certainty regarding these phenomena - removed from mundane existence and experiences - is epistemologically suspicious since there is no valid epistemic intersection of extra-terrestrial realms and the material world. The study also argues that just like any affirmation, any denial of certain knowledge of afterlife and near death experiences conversely rests on logical fallacy of argumentum ad ignorantiam. It then recommends careful and detail examination of these phenomena before their acceptance or rejection, since the belief or non-belief in them influences the way we live our lives. Conclusively, it holds that given the weight of evidence, the affirmations of the claims to afterlife and near death experiences seem more rational than denial, and are more likely to be true than otherwise. The study adopts the conceptual, critical and speculative methods of philosophical inquiry.",

    title: "DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS IN THE ATTITUDE OF POSTGRADUATE STUDENTS TOWARDS THE USE OF INFORMATION RESOURCES IN UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES IN SOUTH-SOUTH, NIGERIA",
    abstract:
      "The study investigated the demographic characteristics in the attitude of postgraduate students towards the use of information resources in university libraries in south-south Nigeria. The specific purpose was to examine the differences in the attitude of male and female postgraduate students towards the use of information resources, explore the disciplinary differences in the attitude of postgraduate students towards the use of information resources, in university libraries located in Edo, Delta, Bayelsa, Akwa-Ibom, Cross River, and Rivers States. Four research questions and four hypotheses were raised to guide this study. The survey method was adopted. A sample of 1,744 was drawn out of the population of 17,449 from which 1,412 was found usable for the study. The reliability of the instrument used for the survey was tested using Cronbach Alpha which yielded an index of (0.87). The data were analyzed using frequency counts, percentage, mean, standard deviation, z-test and ANOVA. The results of analysis revealed that Sex difference and disparate academic discipline influence Postgraduate students’ attitude towards the use of information resources in university libraries in South-South Nigeria. It was recommended that the libraries should be well funded in order to acquire current and relevant information materials, organize symposium on available information resources as part of orientation programme for postgraduate students. Assignments that compel postgraduate students to use library information resources should be encouraged by the academia. Finally the Reference librarians should be accessible for information resources consultation.",

    title: "SUBSIDY REMOVAL POLICY: ANALYSIS OF ISSUES, CHALLENGES AND THE WAY FORWARD IN NIGERIA",
    abstract:
      "While the concept of subsidy is noble, its administration has been plagued with serious issue of corruption and mismanagement thereby causing a huge gap of budget deficit in Nigeria. Successive governments have contemplated the idea of removing subsidy albeit with no effect until May, 2023. This paper examines the contending issues of subsidy removal and discussed the challenges it has incurred while also providing recommendations for the way forward. Relying on secondary data and sustainable development theory, the paper discussed the contending issues that characterized the fuel subsidy regime which are: the Unsustainable subsidy costs, huge distortion of the economy, illegal trade of petroleum products, pervasive corruption and investment related issues. Since the subsidy was removed, it has created nationwide challenges which the paper itemized as purchasing power reduction due to a high inflation rate, dwindling economic activities, prevalence of social unrests in the country and astronomic rise in the prices of petroleum products. The paper therefore concluded that the study therefore concluded that the decision to remove subsidy is quite important. However, much has not been done to mitigate the negative impact on the citizens. The paper recommended that government should implement a sincere, well managed, well-coordinated and corruption free palliative measures to cushion the effect of the subsidy removal. Also, there should be an increase in the minimum wage of workers, fixing local refineries should be a top priority and lastly, the challenge of electricity should be given ultimate attention.",

    abstract:
      "The plan by former president Muhammadu Buhari to lift 100 million Nigerians out of endemic poverty by the year 2030 using appropriate social protection programmes and to know the extent to which this has been achieved through N-Power programmes necessitated the study. The objective of the study was to determine how N-Power worked to reduce the food poverty of beneficiaries in Oredo L.G.A of Edo State. The study leverages empowerment theory and the population of the study comprises N-Power batch A and B enrollees who served in Oredo L.G.A. of Edo State.. The researchers reviewed relevant literature in the area of the study and to have a robust knowledge of the subject matter of discourse the study utilised mixed methods of data collection which involved the use of both quantitative and qualitative methods. Taro Yamani scientific tools were used to obtain an optimum sample size of 345 for N-Power batches A and B respectively. The hypothesis raised was tested with the Pearson correlation statistical method. Findings revealed that N-Power programme has improved the general standard of living of beneficiaries, and closed the food poverty inequality gap between beneficiaries against non-beneficiaries of the programme in the aforementioned local government area. The study recommends that Government should enshrine social protection programmes into the Nigerian constitution, Government at all levels should evolve different food intervention programmes such as food stamps, and food vouchers among others to address the biting challenges of food poverty in Nigeria.",

    abstract:
      "This study centred on mentoring for enhanced employment and employability in library and information science (LIS) education in Nigeria. Descriptive Survey research design was adopted for the investigation. A population of hundred (100) respondents were selected while the sample of fifty (50) respondents made up of librarians in John Harris library responded to the questions. Relevant data were collected from the sample through personal contact method of administration of mentoring for enhanced employment and employability in library and information science (LIS) education Questionnaires (MFEEELISQ). The data collected were presented in Tables and analyzed using simple percentages. The findings from data analyzed include that participation in professional association, provision of sponsorship for conferences, seminar are some of the programmes through which librarians are mentored; enhancement for job employment and employability, improvement of team work and cooperation in the working environment are some of the benefits of mentoring in LIS. The challenges to effective mentoring among librarians include unconstructive criticism by the mentor to the mentee, broken confidentiality by both the mentor and the mentee, absence of mentoring orientation in librarianship and some suggested ways to overcome challenges to effective mentoring. Based on the findings, it is recommended that willingness of the mentor and the mentee to listen and learn from each other is important as well as adequate training should be organized for both mentors and mentees.",

    abstract:
      "The pattern of changes and adjustments in the structure of an economy is an issue of consideration in determining tax performance. Most countries inclusive of countries within ECOWAS sub region have recorded major structural changes over the years and this no doubt has a bearing on tax performance in particular and the economy in general. Structural changes was considered as changes in sectorial shares as it relates to output, productivity growth while tax performance was considered in terms of the ratio of taxes to GDP and the structure of taxation in a panel of fifteen (15) countries of the ECOWAS sub-region covering the period of 2000 to 2017. To this end, varied theories were reviewed while the data set were processed and descriptively presented as it relates to structural changes and tax performance in ECOWAS. It was observed that structural changes did not remarkably reflect in improved tax performance owing to factors such as weak tax laws, ease of paying taxes, high of tax rates. It was then recommended amongst others that there is need for ECOWAS sub region to ensure structural adjustments that are market-based and effectively guided by policies and institutional enforcements.",

The objectives of this study are among others to examine the challenges facing orphans; and identify the services provided for orphans as vulnerable children in Oredo Local Government Edo State. The research design adopted in this study was the survey research design. The study population was the orphans in Oredo Local Government Area, Benin City. One hundred (100) orphans were drawn via purposive sampling technique from orphanage Homes. The findings of this study revealed that orphans were exposed to neglect, violence, exploitation and all forms of abuse. The study also revealed that the Non-Governmental Organizations intervention in assisting the Orphans as Vulnerable Children, OVC is not only necessary but also an indication of societal positive response to the situation and government failure to provide a comprehensive and realistic community oriented framework for the OVC. Furthermore, social workers involvement is needed in ameliorating the problems of the OVC in Edo State. Finally, it was recommended that Government, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and social workers should raise awareness about orphans as vulnerable children at all levels through advocacy and social mobilization. Both the civil society and the media should spread informed messages about orphans as vulnerable children.",

    abstract:
      "The significance of mental health, particularly among secondary school students cannot be overemphasized. This stage in the life of secondary school students is characterized by numerous physiological, emotional, and mental transformations. The objectives of this study are to: identify the main factors contributing to students' mental health issues; determine the effectiveness of the current school social work interventions in addressing students' mental health issues; and to make recommendations on how to improve school social work in Uselu Secondary School in Egor Local Government Area of Edo State. The survey research design was adopted in this study. The primary data collection tool was a questionnaire, supplemented by a thorough review of relevant literature and documents. The sample size for the population of 897 which is approximately 900 at 95 % confidence level and 5% degree of accuracy was two hundred and sixty nine (269). The formula used to determine the sample size was the Krejcie and Morgan Table (1970):  S = X2 NP (1-P) + d2 (N-1) + X2 P (1-P). It was found that school social workers significantly impact students’ mental, behavioral, and academic outcomes. The study emphasized the importance of ongoing professional development for school social workers, suggesting that regular training and support could enhance their ability to effectively support students. The findings also underscored the need for schools to prioritize mental health and wellbeing, recognizing that students’ academic success is closely linked to their mental health. The research also underscored the importance of collaboration between schools and community agencies. The study recommended that school social workers should collaborate with school administrators and community agencies to create a supportive school environment. In conclusion, the research highlighted the importance of a holistic approach to student mental health, emphasizing that school social workers play a key role in connecting students and their families with a range of services.",

      "This study examined peer influence and self-esteem as predictors of substance abuse by sex and school ownership among secondary school adolescents in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State, Nigeria. The correlational survey research design was used. The population of the study comprised of 11985 students in both public and private senior secondary schools in Ovia North East Local Government Area of Edo State. Simple random sampling technique was used to select a sample of 450 students. The findings showed no significant difference in the relationship between peer influence and substance abuse based on sex as well as self-esteem and substance abuse based on sex. A significant difference in the rate of substance abuse was observed between public and private schools. It was therefore recommended that Seminars should be organized for students on how to build and maintain healthy self-esteem, while schools should ensure that they have a working counselling centre and professional counsellors who can offer group and individual counselling sessions for victims of substance abuse with more attention given to public school’s adolescents.",
